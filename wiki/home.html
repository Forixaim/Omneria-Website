		<h2 id="Blurb">The Omneria Official Wiki</h2>
		<p class="Paragraph">The Omneria Archives are one of the most ancient libraries in Omneria, giving away vital information for new travelers and more. There are only a few who view the Archives and therefore are often lost to myth and legend. People may be wondering what are the archives? What do they mostly comprise of? The truth is... We don't know. But, in a few moments you can recognize and hope to understand everything, learn everything, and best of all... master everything. There is more than pages and books that are to be learned from here there are one of the most coveted files of characters, common creatures, and even adversaries that you have fought. There are even those who you fought to gain their trust, to gain their acceptance. That is the true nature of the Archives. What are you now seeing is something that is usually available to everyone, but nobody has ever gotten the chance to look, there are historical records of Omneria, kept clean and virtually free from ink decomposition as well as digital records that has been kept refreshed automatically by the S.A.V.E. system, a complex set of machines that are only accessible by you and you only. Their programmed from hardware to only perform the following. Scan: to scan the setting for potential failing records. Archive: to store new information into the expanding library. reVitalize: To refresh and transfer old archive storage to the newest technology, which is currently being performed. Evaulate: To check the finished reVitalized information to see if it is ready for viewing. All these functions keep the archive as clean and ready to go as quickly as possible.</p>
		<p class="Paragraph">Below are a series of links that go to the information hub. They are your main route of guidance and therefore cherish them. They are your one stop shop. Due to everything being relatively small, expect things to rise drastically as information in the beginning of your adventure can be more intimidating than those who have been veterans. As people of Omneria say... Knowledge is Power, and this Knowledge, will be everyone's power, and due to such, no one will stop you. When you read through every article, be sure to write it down. You can recognize it but you won't learn anything. What are you waiting for? Step into the archives and let the forbidden information be yours. </p>
